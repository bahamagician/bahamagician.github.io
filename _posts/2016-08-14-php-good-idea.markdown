As per my last post, I've been seriously looking into getting a traditional and more mature back end framework under my belt to help me get a much better handle on the front end frameworks that I've been exploring.  I know it sounds like an odd thing to do but I think it helps me understand the front end frameworks like Ember or Angular 2 by understanding exactly what it is that they're trying to emulate.

I last left off by saying I was going to investigate Rails.  However, I've ended up going the PHP route and learning Laravel.  There are a few reasons for this:

- First, I've done a LOT of PHP work in the past.  From hand coded spaghetti code, to a plethora of Wordpress sites.

- Secondly, I have two programmer buddies who've been using Laravel for a while. I figure it'd be nice to have people to go to when things go crazy.

- Lastly and most importantly, I went the route of PHP beacuse I discovered Jeffery Way and (Laracasts)["http://laracasts.com"].

Honestly, I've never seen somebody break down programming knowledge as perfectly as Jeffery Way does it.  I started with just the PHP basics course that he has just to see how I enjoyed his teaching style and that alone made me dive wholesale into Laravel.  That's how great of a teacher he is.  He's the primary reason I've totally abandoned Rails for right now.  If this guy taught Rails, then it'd be a different story.  But he's teaching Laravel and I've jumped on that bandwagon.

In just a few lessons I've already started achieving my goal of gaining a better understanding of the front end frameworks I've been working with.  I have a much better understanding of the MVC pattern and I can't wait to see what's next.
