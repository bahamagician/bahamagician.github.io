When it comes to web development I feel really old.  Just last week I caught myself regaling a fellow developer with
stories about how we didn't used to have the inspector panel back in our day.

As I look back on it, I've went through a lot in a relatively short period of time.  Way back in the day I was an ASP
classic guy, then I moved on to PHP which led me to Wordpress.  I had a few PHP sites hacked and then decided I needed
to get on the bandwagon with something that was developed by people smarter than me.  The problem is, I fell in love
with Wordpress.  I've spent the last 5 plus years developing all of my client's sites within Wordpress.  However, Wordpress
has started to feel stagnant.

I needed something new.  So I started looking around and I found two options that I fell in love with instantly.

The first was Angular 1 which I'd stumbled across on Code School's free course.  It blew my mind that I could pull data
from a database and serve it to users all by just using Javascript.  Also, because I'd been stuck in the Wordpress
realm, I'd never heard of MVC before and the implications of it thrilled me.  I quickly learned however, that Angular 1
was on it's way out and everyone was eagerly awaiting the release of Angular 2 which was completely different.  I didn't
want to spend the time learning Angular 1 if it was going to completely be revamped, so this led me to investigate other
JavaScript frameworks like Ember and React, but I quickly discounted them due to the lack of following they had compared
to Angular.  I decided to join the rest of the world and just wait for the release of Angular 2.

As I waited I investigated more in regards to MVC and ended up stumbling across Ruby on Rails.  OMFG, why couldn't I have
found this shit just 2 years earlier.  I swear it would've probably changed my life and my career.  I'd never heard of
ORM, so Active Record literally blew my face off.  The last time I'd worked with a SQL database outside of Wordpress I'd
written raw SQL code.  I'm talking full on inner-joins and the works.  So having a framework effortlessly interface with
a database left me with a full on chub for the rest of the day.

So I spent some time on a course on Udemy building out a blog in rails.  It was all good until it neared the end of the
course in which I was pretty much just re-typing what the instructor was showing me.  I started to realize that I wasn't
learning much towards the end.  That's when I discovered Michael Hartl and The Rails Tutorial.  However, that's also the
same time of Angular 2 RC-1.

So over the past few months I've been tinkering witn the MEAN Stack with Angular 2.  I've played with Mongo, Express and
the entire package.  There have been ups and downs but the main takeaway I feel is that I'm probably going to want to
go back to Rails at some point and put in the effort to learn it well.  Yes I agree that JavaScript is the future.  But
right now it still feels like the MEAN stack has some maturing to do.  For example, why does Mongoose require a plugin
for unique validation?  Shouldn't somebody at some point in development have thought maybe that's something that should
be built in to an ORM?  The other problem is that I feel like I need to get a mature framework under my belt so I can
better understand what JavaScript frameworks are trying to emulate.  For example, a buddy told me that Angular 2 services
are like Repositories in Laravel.  As I have never worked with Laravel, I'd had no idea what he was talking about, however
it was clear to me that he benefited from having something he could compare it to.

So with that said, my plans are to continue my MEAN stack journey but at the same time, I'm going to try and tackle the
Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl.
