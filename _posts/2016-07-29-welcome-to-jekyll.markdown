I've been interested in static blogs/websites for quite some time now.  I've done a **TON** of work with the Zurb Stack and Foundation 6 in which they use something called [Panini](https://github.com/zurb/panini) which is a flat file compiler. By their own admission Panini is not a full-fleged static site generator but it did interest me enough to push me down the rabbit hole.  

The tipping point for me was a [lecture I watched](https://vimeo.com/174172567) at the Smashing Conference in NYC by Phil Hawksworth.  His lecture was all the encouragement I needed to start investigating the territory of static sites.

I spent some time courting [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and really did like what I saw, but I decided to at least start with Jekyll which seems to be the Wordpress of the static website world.  Additionally, I wanted my first static site to be a blog and Jekyll seems to be suited more towards blogging whereas Middleman seems more suited to full blown websites as it requires you to install an add-on for the blogging functionality.
